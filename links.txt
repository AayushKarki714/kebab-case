locally it worked but on deployment. it didn't work because of git ignoring the case (even though i can make it work in my computer, but what if I am working with team of developers) 
so if you locally changed it to LoginForm to loginForm, git willn't detect it and it will not be updated into your repository
so this can lead to deployment issues and so on

After considering all of this things, I am moving to kebab case for my file names  (also kebab-case looks good to me)
